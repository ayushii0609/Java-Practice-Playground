Overview

This repository is a collection of Java code solutions and examples covering various fundamental data structures and algorithms. It serves as a personal "playground" where I've practiced and implemented solutions for different coding challenges and concepts. This project was created primarily for learning and skill development.

Contents 📚

You'll find practical implementations for topics like:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Recursion
Strings
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Sorting & Searching Algorithms
Stacks & Queues
And more!

Getting Started 💡

To run the code, you'll need Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+. Simply clone the repository and compile/run individual .java files using your preferred IDE or command line.
